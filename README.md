html+javascript helper for pandemic 2 board game

https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/221107/pandemic-legacy-season-2

keeps track of what cards are on the top of deck

index1 and index2 versions as at one point mechanics change and logic update was needed

ducked taped JS, a miracle it works :)

initial state "data" is inserted by editing page

but battle tested - helped us make better decisions as none of us wanted to memorize all cards and doing bookkiping on paper was not working
